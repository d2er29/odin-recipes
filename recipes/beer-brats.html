  <h3>Description</h3>
    <p class="desc">The brats will make your mouth water. They are super easy to make 
      and are one of my go-tos for get togethers.
      They take little time and are very hands off. 
      The end result is a very juicy and delicious brat 
      with a subtle beer taste that enhances the flavors of the brat.

  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cans of a mild beer (Pilzners are a good choice) </li>
      <li>1 package of raw brats  </li>
    </ul>  
  <h4></h4> 
    <ol>
      <li> Pour beers into a large pot and bring to a low boil. </li>
      <li> Add brats to beer pot and boil for 20 minutes to ensure cooking through. </li>
      <li> While brats are boiling bring grill up to temp to a medium high heat.</li>
      <li> Once brats are done boiling take out of beer and put directly on grill.</li>
      <li> Cook on grill until you get the desired grill marks. 
        This step is personal preference since brats will be already cooked from the boil. </li>
      <li> Pull brats off of grill and put in bun with favorite condiments, or otherwise. </li>
    </ol>
